# Who We Are

---

The Sardius Media team has been serving ministry, corporate, and government
clients with live streaming and video-on-demand solutions for over a decade. We
have served many Christian ministries because the genesis of the Sardius team
was overseeing a 24/7 prayer broadcast for many years (and we still do this
today!). From this jumping-off point, the team began to serve more and more
clients until Sardius Media began in 2014.

Supporting many large scale live events with live-broadcasts and on-demand video
combined with much custom development for many large clients is how we grew and
what we continue to do. Through all of this “in-the-field” work, we have come to
understand that although most of our solutions have been custom-built there are
so many commonalities for many of our enterprise clients that in 2020 we have
rolled out the new Sardius LIVE Online Video Platform - one of the most
intuitive and reliable online video platforms on the market.

Our dedication to excellence in service is born out by the fact that our client
churn rate is almost zero. We love to figure out where your pain points are and
eliminate them altogether - so let’s chat today, we’d love to help you.
